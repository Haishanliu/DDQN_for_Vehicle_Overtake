# Reinforcement Learning for Vehicle Overtake
In this project, we trained a DDQN agent to solve the autonomous vehicle highway overtake problem based on a well-built [gym-like highway environment](https://highway-env.farama.org/).


## Quick Demo
The green vehicle is the ego-vehicle, trained with the DDQN algorithm. Blue vehicles are the traditional human-driven vehicles.
